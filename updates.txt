error running synapse server "port 8448 already in use"
used "fuser -k 8448/tcp" to get around this problem. Did "synctl start" to start synapse server again.

Today tried to use api's directly from matrix.org rather than local server.

There are 2 types of user to matrix a) user b) guest

register "guest" user to matrix.org server:(works fine)

tried "Catherine3982","@Catherine3982:matrix.org", as value to "user" key; but same error

register user to matrix.org server: (didn't try out after first stage. felt it's unnecessary)
_____________________________________
Its a multistaged interactive process called flows
Each flows may have different stages
status_code 401 is returned by server, until registration is successfully completed with status_code = 200
"session" key remains constant throughout the stages. it must be returned within "auth" key during interactions. "auth" key also contains "type" & another key corresponding to stage in which the process is in. When a stage is completed the server returns a "complete" key containing stages completed.

But not necessary for this project i feel..

login my already registered account at riot.im:(works fine)

logging in my already registered account works. But the guest user account (created today) login doesn't work

messaging to a created room:(works fine)

REGISTER:

registered a new user in local server using curl command

''' curl -XPOST -d '{"username":"example", "password":"wordpass", "auth": {"type":"m.login.dummy"}}' "https://localhost:8448/_matrix/client/r0/register" '''
error with ssl certficate
entered the same above command using "-k" option of curl to get it done.

tried to do the same with python's requests module.
set 'verify = False' to avoid ssl certificate issue.

Installed matrix-synapse which would be nedded to test things locally. Installed correctly. Configuring synapse got lot of import error. solved some of them. But few other error's is about missing packages.

Error1:
ImportError: No module named 'Queue'

>>> pip3 install Queue
Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement Queue (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for Queue

vi lib/python3.5/site-packages/synapse/storage/event_federation.py
entered "from multiprocessing import Queue"
and tried configuring again.
But still the same error
There is no other file named Queue.py in the directory containing the event_federeation.py file 
rectified that mistake by renaming Queue with queue

Similar errors related to packages compatability between python2 and python3
Uninstalled the done installation and trying to install based on python2.7

got the synapse server running
