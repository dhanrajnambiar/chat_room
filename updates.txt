8th Jan 2018:

a)Installed matrix-synapse which would be nedded to test things locally. Installed correctly. Configuring synapse got lot of import error. solved some of them. But few other error's is about missing packages.

Error1:
ImportError: No module named 'Queue'

>>> pip3 install Queue
Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement Queue (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for Queue

vi lib/python3.5/site-packages/synapse/storage/event_federation.py
entered "from multiprocessing import Queue"
and tried configuring again.
But still the same error
There is no other file Queue.py in the directory containing the event_federeation.py file 
rectified that mistake by renaming Queue with queue

Similar errors related to packages compatability between python2 and python3
Uninstalled the done installation and trying to install based on python2.7

got the synapse server running
